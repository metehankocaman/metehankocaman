## About Me

- Built real-time systems using Fiber Bragg Grating sensors, ESP32, and Python GUIs  
- Comfortable with RF tools (spectrum/network analyzers), embedded protocols (UART, SPI, I2C), and automation (PyVISA, SCPI)  
- Most of my work involves writing clean, testable code that interacts with hardware and produces useful data  
- Interested in working on hardware validation, integration, and anything involving signal flow and debugging
